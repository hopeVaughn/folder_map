## Introduction

This document provides a brief overview of a React application that allows users to generate an ASCII diagram based on the folder structure of a drag-and-dropped folder. The application is built using various technologies, including TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and React.

## Description

The application is designed to allow users to drag and drop a folder into an input field, which generates an ASCII diagram based on the folder structure. The front-end is built using TypeScript and React, with Tailwind CSS for styling. The necessary information to generate the ASCII diagram will be stored in local storage instead of a database.

The main page component is rendered in `App.tsx`, with several other components used to make up the page. The back-end server code is written in TypeScript.

## Technologies used

- TypeScript for both front-end and back-end development
- React as the front-end framework
- Tailwind CSS for styling
